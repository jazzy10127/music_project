			<h2>  history of music </h2>

				<p> Music can be dated back as early as 35,000 years ago. They found significant
					ways to create music with hand made instruments. For example they would
					make flutes out of animal bones. It's also believed that precussions instruments
					 were the most commonly used because of how available they were, such as using rocks
					or sticks as drums.  </p>
